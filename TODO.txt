- look into having to run cmake twice to get typemaps included?
- dependency problems

-* configuring PyBuffer yields the following error message during the
"generate" stage (i.e. in windows configuring goes well, finally
clicking on "OK" yields this error):

. CMake Error: Unknown Target referenced: _ITKCommonAPython
(click on OK again, then:)
. CMake Error: Target: _BufferConversionPython depends on unknown
target: _ITKCommonAPython

- wrappers for binary threshold, relabel filters don't make a lot of sense
- rename some of the basic type names
- better ld path fix for itkbase.py
- continuousindex should accept float seq
- update article with new wrappong methods
