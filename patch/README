Patches in the 'old_itk_compatibility' directory are *required* for
WrapITK to work with versions of ITK lower than 2.6. The 
'old_itk_compatibility' patches have all been incorporated into ITK
version 2.6.

Patches in the 'optional' directory provide optional, but useful,
convenience functionality like renamed operators and easier-to-use
function signatures. Additionally, there are some specific python
wrapping patches, which provide the ability to treat Index, Point,
(etc.) values as python sequences and the ability to see decent
representations of many common objects with __str__ (and 'print').

To apply these patch files, go to the 'Code' 
directory in the ITK source or build tree, or to the
'InsightToolkit' directory in the install tree (depending on
where you want to install the patches).

Once you are in that directory, run the following commands,
depending on which patch sets you wish/need to apply:

cat path/to/patch/old_itk_compatibility/* | patch -p3
cat path/to/patch/optional/* | patch -p1

(where 'path/to' is replaced with the actual path
to this 'patch' directory).
