This dir contains patchs to apply to the ITK sources.
- patchs in 'required' dir are required to build the wrappers and should be
integrated in future ITK releases
- patches in 'optional' are not required but highly recommended because they
brings new functionnalities to the wrappers

To apply the patches, go in the ITK installation dir and do something like

  cat /home/gaetan/src/WrapITK/patch/required/* | patch -p3

for the required patches, and 

  cat /home/gaetan/src/WrapITK/patch/optional/* | patch -p3
  
for the optional patches.
