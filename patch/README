Patches in the 'old_itk_compatibility' directory are *required* for
WrapITK to work with versions of ITK lower than 2.6. The 
'old_itk_compatibility' patches have all been incorporated into ITK
version 2.6.

Patches in the 'python_interface' directory provide optional python
language abilities, such as the ability to treat Index, Point, (etc.)
values as python sequences, the ability to see decent representations
of many common objects with __repr__ (and 'print'), and the ability
to increment iterators.

To apply these patch files, go to the 'Code' 
directory in the ITK source or build tree, or to the
'InsightToolkit' directory in the install tree (depending on
where you want to install the patches).

Once you are in that directory, run the following commands,
depending on which patch sets you wish/need to apply:

cat path/to/patch/old_itk_compatibility/* > patch -p3
cat path/to/patch/python_interface/* > patch -p1

(where 'path/to' is replaced with the actual path
to this 'patch' directory).
